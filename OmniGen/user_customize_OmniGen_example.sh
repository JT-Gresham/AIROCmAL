####  This file is for you to add any code you want to execute just before OmniGen launches.  This will not be updated when AIROCmAL or OmniGen updates.
####  This is useful if you want to create custom presets and make sure your code, links, etc gets put back after an official update from the OmniGen team.
####  I'll include the code I wrote to load my own custom preset as an example.  I didn't wnat to do this every time the OmniGen team updated...

####  THIS CODE STARTS IN YOUR PARENT DIRECTORY
####    eg: where the AIROCmAL directory is located

#### EXAMPLE CODE ####

#  Change directory to make things easier
#cd $pdirectory/AIROCmAL
