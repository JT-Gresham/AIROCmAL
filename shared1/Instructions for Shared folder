This folder is to provide the initial structure for AIROCmAL to find any LLMs, safetensor, wildcards...etc...
  ...that you might want to share between AI programs within the AIROCmAL framework.

Use this by renaming the "shared1" directory to "shared"...ie: just remove the 1 from the name.  Do this before running anything the first time.

Why? :
Just in case gitignore doesn't do what it should when updating.  I've had this happen and it wiped my library and we all know how big those LLMs can get.
Major PITA to re-download them, so I did it this way as a measure of protection.

This is expreimental for now...
